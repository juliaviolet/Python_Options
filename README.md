# Python_Options
ðŸ‘‹ Greetings. These repositories reflect a methodical problem-solving approach, using a mix of financial theory and practical Python implementation to navigate complex data sets and extract actionable insights.
Monte Carlo simulations, computational finance, and stochastic processes are central elements in this work. The application of a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model allows for the successful simulation of price paths for underlying assets. Leveraging this model, classes for European options, Lookback options, and Asian options have been developed, with the ability to handle both fixed-strike and floating-strike scenarios.
Each repository showcases a proficient use of Python, Jupyter notebooks, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and sklearn. A systematic approach to data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and machine learning model implementation is consistently displayed.
These repositories will undergo continuous enhancements over the coming months as part of a commitment to lifelong learning and improvement.
Feel free to explore these repositories, offer feedback, and ask questions. Suggestions for collaboration and ideas for tackling financial problems with data science are always welcome. This space encourages collective growth and learning.
