# Python_Options
In the domain of computational finance, my primary focus is on options pricing. Leveraging a robust foundation in Python, I delve into and apply various options pricing models, notably the Black-Scholes-Merton, Heston, Merton, Bates, and BCC models. Each repository elucidates the theoretical underpinnings and their tangible applications, with comprehensive Jupyter notebooks shedding light on the intricacies. A strong emphasis on calibration and error estimation attests to a steadfast commitment to accuracy and precision, complemented by detailed data visualizations such as error plots.

Beyond options pricing, these repositories illustrate a meticulous problem-solving approach, harmonizing financial theory with practical Python implementation to decipher multifaceted data sets and distill actionable insights. Central to this work are Monte Carlo simulations, stochastic processes, and the adept use of the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model for simulating asset price paths. This expertise extends to the development of classes for European, Lookback, and Asian options, catering to both fixed and floating-strike scenarios.

Proficiency shines through in the consistent use of tools like pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and sklearn, revealing a structured approach to data exploration, visualization, and machine learning model deployment. As an advocate for open-source and collaborative growth, I am committed to refining these repositories over time. Colleagues and peers are invited to engage with this space, offer feedback, pose queries, or suggest collaborations. Here, the goal is collective advancement in understanding and applying financial data science.
