        "The **BCC97** model seamlessly merges the **H93** model's stochastic volatility with the **M76** model's jump diffusion, introducing correlated jumps in volatility and the incorporation of the **CIR** process to model stochastic interest rates.\n",

        "1. **Optimization**: A tailored objective function helped calibrate the model's parameters until errors fell below 5%.\n",
        "2. **Visualization**: I employed 3D plots (using Matplotlib) for call and put options, overlaying model prices against market prices. A detailed scatter plot (using Plotly) was also crafted, color-coded by percentage error, providing an insightful view of model accuracy.\n",

        "**Results:**  \n",
        "Post recalibration, the BCC model aligned closely with market prices, consistently reflecting a percentage error below 5%.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Tools & Techniques:**  \n",
        "1. **Characteristic Functions**: Essential for Fourier-based pricing.\n",
        "2. **Numerical & Optimization Tools**: Leveraged `quad` for integrals and `minimize` for model calibration.\n",
        "3. **Data Manipulation**: Utilized Pandas and NumPy.\n",
        "4. **Performance**: The `njit` decorator from Numba ensured efficient calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Strengths & Weaknesses:**  \n",
        "1. **Strengths**: BCC's granularity captures various market dynamics, adeptly handles correlations, and is adaptable to myriad market scenarios.\n",
        "2. **Weaknesses**: Its detailed architecture demands computational rigor, calibration poses challenges, and overfitting is a potential risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Improvement Avenues:**  \n",
        "1. **Efficiency**: Further code enhancements.\n",
        "2. **Parameter Stability**: Using constraints for consistent estimates.\n",
        "3. **Validation**: Intensive testing against benchmarks and real-world data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:**  \n",
        "The BCC model, profound in its detail and flexibility, emerges as a powerful instrument for option pricing in financial analysis. With the right computational approach, as exhibited here, it can predict prices with remarkable accuracy, underscoring its real-world applicability."
